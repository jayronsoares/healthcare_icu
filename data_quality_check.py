"""
Develop data quality checks: Develop automated checks to validate data quality dimensions during data ingestion, transformation, and loading processes. 
This includes checking for accuracy, completeness, consistency, timeliness, relevance, validity, precision, and uniqueness.
This example assumes that the data is stored in a CSV file named data.csv and that the data quality checks are performed on a Pandas DataFrame.
The run_data_quality_checks() function runs all the data quality checks and returns a list of results, and the main() function loads the data, 
runs the data quality checks, and prints the results. 
This example also uses functional programming best practices, such as using pure functions and avoiding side effects.
